<h2> About DamienDash</h2>
<p>DamienDash is a way for students on the Ualbany campus to get campus center dining without having to leave
either the comfort of their dorm. OR an intense study session with friends. Just like with other 
popular delivery services we offer fast reliable delivery, only on the Ualbany campus for students delivered by other students
leading to undergraduates being able to make extra money while pursuing their degree. We believe every great dane deserves the convenience of this service
especially those in the empire, freedom and liberty apartments. 
Its a Great Day to be a Great Dane
Especially if you're a Dane Dasher

<h2>Our Vision and Mission</h2>
</p>Our mission is to not only provide reliable and quality service to those on the Ualbany campus but one day eventually branch out
and we can have DamienDash's on every single campus everywhere. They of course wouldn't be called Damien Dash,not everyone can be a Great Dane sadly.
But we can have a variation of this service among a plethora of different campuses starting with the SUNY system.
But before that our mission is to provide the highest quality service for our undergrads, in speed, safety and reliability.
We love being able to serve not only our couriers but our Danes who order.
